# Hi, I'm James 🌱🌍 

I'm a builder and product leader 🛠 who's passionate about using technology to improve co-ordination in order to fund the commons, pay for public goods and address the greater issues in our time including - social and environmental problems and funding open source software. 

I believe public blockchains and Zero Knowledge enable co-ordination and collaboration in ground breaking ways, and I'm always looking to unlock new portals that didn't previously exist in order to beam us into a better future.

Previous work includes:

🌱 Co-founder of Toucan.earth, with aims to rapidly scale the impact of planet-positive projects by turning carbon credits into tokens on public blockchains

🌴 Founding member of KlimaDAO.finance (🌳,🌳), which fights climate change through it's digital carbon backed currency

❤️ Tech lead at Giveth.io

⚗️ Tech lead at Alchemist

Let's build out own utopian future where technology serves as a catalyst for positive change for us all! 🌿🌐
